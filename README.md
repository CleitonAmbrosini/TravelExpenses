* doc: ideal when adding or modifying some documentation in the code or repository in question.
Example: adding documentation about the response of an API or adding a README.md.

* env: used when modifying or adding any CI/CD file.
Example: modify a Dockerfile command or add a step to a Jenkinsfile.

* feat: used when adding some new functionality from scratch to the code/service/project.
Example: adding a new endpoint for a REST API or a new consumer for a messaging service.
